        <h2>Discord Calls/Video Chats</h2>
        <p>Discord is a service used for communicating with others. Their calling service truly does outrank most other services.<br>They host a user-friendly interface, having different buttons that would be easily understandable to a new user.</p>
        <h4>Call Buttons</h4>
        <p>The call buttons listed (left to right) are:</p>
        <ul>
            <img src = "https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360060967112/new_buttons_for_video_and_screenshare_copy_2.png" alt="disc call" height="106px" width="358px">
            <li>VIDEO TOGGLE</li>
            <p>Gives the user the choice of turning their camera on or off.</p>
            <li>AUDIO OUTPUT</li>
            <p>Offers 'Speaker' and 'Phone' options. 'Speaker' is louder, and 'Phone' plays like a regular call.</p>
            <li>MICROPHONE TOGGLE</li>
            <p>Toggles your microphone on and off.</p>
            <li>END CALL</li>
            <p>With the simple press of a button, your call will come to a stop.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Your Profile</h2>
        <p>You are a unique individual. Make your profile as unique as you are! Discord lets users change...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>STATUSES</li>
            <p>Timed snippets of what you're thinking. Can add emojis to truly express yourself. Or, if you think that way all the time,<br>there is a 'Don't Clear' option.</p>
            <li>ABOUT ME</li>
            <p>Your about me is your bio. Anything like pronouns, names, websites, or even silly things can be added on there!</p>
            <li>PROFILE PICTURES</li>
            <p>This describes who you are, essentially. Who people will see you as on the internet. With free Discord,<br> users can choose still images (jpg, jpeg, png, etc) as their photo. Discord Nitro users, however, can use both still images <i>and</i>gifs</p>
            <li>PROFILE BANNER</li>
            <p>Profile banners are yet another way to express yourself. With free Discord, users can only choose a color for their profile banner. <br> However, with Discord Nitro, users can both use still images (jpg, jpeg, png, etc.) and gifs.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Servers</h2>
        <h4>Servers are a great way to meet other people who share your same interests.</h4>
        <p>To join a server...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get the join link of the server you want to join.</li>
            <li>Confirming that it isn't expired, it should bring you to a page that has "[user] has invited you to join [server name]".</li>
            <li>Click "Accept Invite" to be officially brought into the server.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the link is expired, ask admin for new link.</p>
        <p>To create a server...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the plus sign to the right of your screen.</li>
            <li>You can choose from a template given, or create one from scratch.</li>
            <li>After that.. the world is your oyster! Add text/voice channels, roles, and more!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Groupchats</h2>
        <h4>Groupchats are essentially smaller servers. They can hold up to 10 people and are great for just about everything.</h4>
        <p>How to make a groupchat...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to the "Direct Messages" section of the application.</li>
            <li>Click this button.</li>
            <li>Add 2 or more people to get the party started!</li>
        </ol>
