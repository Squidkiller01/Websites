    <h3>Discord Developer Mode</h3>
    <p>Discord Developer Mode is a setting you can find in the advanced app settings on your discord. <br>It allows for easier access to things like discord tags and such for easier use of creating and/or using or testing Discord bots!</p>
    
    <h3>Server Nitro</h3>
    <p>Nitro boosting a server allows the server members and owners know that you support them and allow everybody + you in the server access to special perks for each and all different boost levels!<br>For boosting a discord server, you get a custom role made for you in the server by the name of "Server booster," <br>at which the owners of the discord server can set special perks and permissions for that role so you can do things that other people cannot! <br>When you boost a discord server, it gets you closer to the multiple different tiers of boosts on a server!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boosts = Friends tier</li>
        <li>7 boosts = Groups tier</li>
        <li>14 boosts = Communities tier</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each tier has their own permissions and of course as you guessed, Communities tier has the most perks for everybody on the server!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Friends tier:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>- Allows you to add Custom stickers and adds more emoji slots</li>
            <li>- Gives access to everyone on that server better audio and video quality when streaming on that server!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Groups tier:</li>
        <ul>    
            <li>- Everything Friends tier provides</li>
            <li>- Allows you to upload a custom server banner</li>
            <li>- Allows members to stream in 1080p and allows the server administrators to create private threads!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Communities tier:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>- Everything in the friends and groups tier</li>
            <li>- Allows you to create custom invite links</li>
            <li>- Allows access to an animated server icon, animated banner, and a custom server invite background!</li>
            <li>- Allows all members in the server access to 1080p/60fps streaming quality and high quality audio with 100MB uploads!</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h3>Server Community</h3>
    <p>Making your server a community server comes with many perks such as server tools to help out with moderation, running the server, and to grow your server! <br>Enabling community on your server comes with an entire seperate server settings category to play around with that includes the overview page, Server Insights, Partner Program, Discovery, Membership Screening, and the Welcome Screen!</p>
    <ol>
    
        <li><h4>Overview Page</h4></li>
        <p>The Overview page of a discord server allows you to apply:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> A Rules or Guidelines Channel</li>
            <li> A Community Updates Channel (notfies server admins of new perks on the server such as threads, etc.)</li>
            <li> Set the server's primary language</li>
            <li> Set a server description</li>
            <li> An option to disable Community</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Server Insights page</h4></li>
        <p>The Server Insights page of a discord server provides server admins with analytical data about who has joined their server, looked at the rules, welcome, etc. <br>If your server has 500+ members in it, you get access to more analytical data from your server insights data such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Growth & Activation stats</li>
            <li> Engagement stats (actively chatting members)</li>
            <li> Audience stats</li>
            <li> Partner Program</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li><h4>Partner Program</h4></li>
        <ul>
            <li> Must be a Safe Environment</li>
            <li> Must have at least 500 members</li>
            <li> Server must be more than 8 weeks old</li>
            <li> Server must have active members</li>
            <li> Moderators on the server must be required to have 2FA enabled on their account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some perks that a Partnership on your server is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Unique Branding</li>
            <p><tag = "description">Custom server url, Server banner, and invite splash</tag></p>
            <li> Partner-only Perks</li>
            <p><tag = "description">Get gifted Discord Nitro, and other rewards to host giveaways to your community and allows access to the partners-only discord server</tag></p>

            <p><tag = "description">Gives your server a special badge to stand out frmo the crowd on the discorvery page</tag></p>
        </ul>
        
        <li><h4>Discovery Page</h4></li>
        <p>Enabling Server Discovery on a discord server allows your server and an invite to your server to be seen to all members from all over on the Discord Discovery Page. <br>Server Discovery comes with the same requirements as a discord partnership but instead of 500 members, you must have 1000 members</p>
        
        <li><h4>Membership Screening Page</h4></li>
        <p>Allows all new members to the discord server to be required to read a certain channel like a rules channel and agree to them before they can type or read any content on the server</p>
        
        <li><h4>Welcome Screen Page</h4></li>
        <p>When enabled shows a custom list of channels in a server that an administrator recommends to new members to read or check up on and provides a short description of the server!</p>

    <p>HypeSquads are a little nod to Harry Potter as the squads represent different houses to be a part of through a personality quiz! I personally (Michael Porter) am in the House of Brilliance.<br>There are 3 different houses to be apart of:</p>
    <ol>    
        <li> The house of Bravery, you like to take risks</li>
        <li> The house of Billiance, you are generally pretty smart and think logially</li>
        <li> The house of Balance, you take nobody's side on things and try to make things more even and fair</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Being apart of a discord HypeSquad provides you with multiple perks such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> Gaining access to a Super Secret Newsletter</li>
        <li> Having a Hype Profile Badge to display to everyone else</li>
        <li> Squad challenges to compete against other houses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Being apart of a HypeSquad also allows you to rep HypeSquad events as well! It allows you to register to host or moderate at several real life HypeSquad events. <br>For repping at a HypeSquad event, discord will send you HypeSquad merch and swag to keep for yourself and to hand out to others during HypeSquad events!</p>
    
    <h3>Streamer Mode</h3>
    <p>Community streamers can enable streamer mode on discord to hide all personal information that may be revealed in normal circumstances. With Streamer Mode on, it will automatically hide all that information!</p>
