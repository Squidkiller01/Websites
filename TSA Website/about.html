            <h3>Creed</h3>
            <hr>
            I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.<br>
            <br>
            I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.

            <hr>
            The Technology Student Association (TSA) aims to enhance personal development, leadership, and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), whereby members apply and integrate these concepts through intracurricular activities, competitions, and related programs.

            <h3>Chapters</h3>
            <hr>
            TSA chapters take the study of STEM beyond the classroom and give students the chance to pursue academic challenges among friends with similar goals and interests. Together, TSA chapter members work on competitive events, learn and apply leadership skills, and may attend conferences at the state, regional, and national levels. TSA chapters also are committed to a national service project and are among the most service-oriented groups in the community. TSA members may become officers within their state and then run for national office. To learn how to start a TSA chapter, call 703-860-9000 or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.registermychapter.com/tsa/nat/AffLogin.aspx">join TSA</a>.
